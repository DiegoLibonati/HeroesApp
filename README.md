## Description

I made a web application with React JS with Firebase for user authentication since this application has a login and a register. Also once we log in with an account or with google we can see in the main section different types of heroes and each hero we can see a mini chart with his name, his publisher, a description and a button to access more information about that hero. In addition this APP has a search through the browser bar which will search for the publisher and bring all the heroes of that specific publisher. It also has a search section where we can search by the name of our favorite hero.

## Technologies used
